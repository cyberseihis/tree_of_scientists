'Wang', 0 Wang received a summa cum laude Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Minnesota (advisor: Dennis Hejhal ), an M.S. in Mathematics and an M.S. in Computer Science , both from Stanford University , and a Ph.D. degree in Medical Information Sciences from Stanford University 's Biomedical Informatics and Database groups (advisor: Gio Wiederhold , committee members: Hector Garcia-Molina and Stephen T.C. Wong).
'Wadler', 2 Wadler received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from Stanford University in 1977, and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1979. [9] He completed his Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in 1984. His thesis was entitled Listlessness is Better than Laziness and was supervised by Nico Habermann . [10] [4]
'Wegner', 2 Wegner was educated at University of Cambridge and received a Post-Graduate Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing in 1954, at a time when there were no PhD programs in computer science. [1] He was awarded a PhD from the University of London in 1968 for his book Programming Languages, Information Structures, and Machine Organization , with Maurice Wilkes listed as his supervisor. [10] [3]
'Widom', 6 Widom earned a BS degree in trumpet performance from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in 1982 and a PhD in computer science under David Gries from Cornell University in 1987. [3] [4]
'Wilkinson', 3 Born in Strood , England, he won a Foundation Scholarship to Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School in Rochester . [6] He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge , where he graduated as Senior Wrangler . [7]
'Winograd', 1 Winograd grew up in Colorado and graduated from Colorado College in 1966. He wrote SHRDLU as a PhD thesis at MIT in the years from 1968–70. In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient "understanding" to be able to use natural language. Winograd built a blocks world , restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated "world of toy blocks". The program could accept commands such as, "Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving  arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, "I do not know which block you mean." The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or "brittle" such programs are. [4]
'Wolfram', 1 Wolfram was educated at Eton College , but left prematurely in 1976. [16] As a young child, Wolfram had difficulties learning arithmetic. [17] At the age of 12, he wrote a directory of physics. [18] By age 14, he had written three books on particle physics. [19] [20] [21] He entered St. John's College, Oxford , at age 17 and left in 1978 [22] without graduating [23] [24] to attend the California Institute of Technology the following year, where he received a PhD [25] in particle physics in 1980. [26] Wolfram's thesis committee was composed of Richard Feynman , Peter Goldreich , Frank J. Sciulli and Steven Frautschi , and chaired by Richard D. Field . [26] [27]
'Zdonik', 0 Zdonik has received a number of non- honorary degrees during his career, all from MIT. [7]
